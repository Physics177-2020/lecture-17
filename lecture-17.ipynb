    "In the last lecture we saw that, even after implementing a reasonable [line search](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Line_search) method, it can take a long time for gradient descent algorithms to approach the minimum of a function. One example where this can happen is in multidimensional functions where the curvature along different dimensions is significantly unbalanced. \n",
    "\n",
    "[Newton's method](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Newton%27s_method_in_optimization) can help us to get around this specific problem by taking the curvature of the function into account. This method works by expanding the function $f(\\underline{x})$ to second order,\n",

    "$$\n",

    "We can then solve for the step direction $\\underline{s}$ that minimizes the function. The resulting step direction is called the **Newtwon direction**,\n",

    "Note that this direction is different from the steepest descent direction! One interesting feature of Newton's method is that, unlike steepest descent, the equation above sets a \"natural\" step length. \n",

As a result, it becomes harder to effectively \"move\" the parameters along the first dimension with gradient descent. Let's begin to explore this by plotting the function."
